This repository chronicles my journey in mastering machine learning, a vast and multifaceted field.

With over a decade of software engineering experience, I will curate my learning path, selecting readings and projects that align with my goals. This README will document my decisions and progress.

## [Building Micrograd](Building_Micrograd)

These notes are inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [lecture](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=EEvw2IrjMnSUlarf) on building Micrograd. Special thanks to Andrej Karpathy for sharing this resource.

Micrograd delves into the intricacies of backpropagation.

### What's Next?

After Micrograd, the next logical step might be to explore [The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=0P3tMmIL90n7jvrL).

However, I feel the need to focus on practicing neural networks and engaging in practical projects. Therefore, instead of makemore, I plan to spend a few days studying PyTorch and undertaking a domain-specific deep learning course.
